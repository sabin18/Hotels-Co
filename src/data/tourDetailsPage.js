      text: "The dammuso is found in the natural reserve of Bugeber, Pantellerìa, and it is sorrounded by a large lecci woods. The house is dominated by a panorama that every day leaves one breathless for its beauty and subtetlies the blues of the sea and the sky and the turquoise of the lake. In the evening one sees the moon mirrored in the lake, the milky way illuminating the sky and then, like a gift, the wellwishing falling stars. The lighthouse in the distance reminds one that the sea is just in front. Now, just turn on some music and relax into this extraordinary place. The dammuso is in the typical rustico pantesco style, faced with cut stone creating a harmony between the myriade of asymmetrical stone terraces and the green of the mediterranean bush. The dammuso has two covered patios that measure two handred square meters. The dammuso can sleelp 5 o 6 people. Sheet and towels are furnished as well as for preparing meals and dining, even for real gourmets. There is also satellite television wirìth international channels, with cd player, free satellite wi fi internet, hair dryer and iron. On request it is possibile to have a cleaning service.",
