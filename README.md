  - Here is to anlyse and set delivery time of the project
  - Set number of the tasks according the number of people who will be working on.
  
- Find technology to be used to build application:
  - Choose the ui/ux design tools :
     - figma, adobe xd ect
  - Choose backend tools:
     - visual studio : development tools
     - node js as backend framework
     - mongoo or postgrace as databse
   - frontend tools:
    - react 
    - next js
    
- Analyse the requirement and business goal 
  - analyse the functionality and how you are going to implement them in code according to business requirement
  - set the task and management tools :
    - create the task that will be implemented by development and add them to :
      - jira or pivatal tracker or other task management tools

- Form team to build the appliaction:

### Maintainace and testing:
- before launching the product , it should be tested by testers and small business team
- trainings if there are some training required for users
- review the production also before publishing on the appliaction to make sure production have same function as test server
- launching application 
- upgrade and fixing somewhere there will need chages according to user experience 
- test the chnages on test sever before publishing or adding new changes to make sure that there will be no crushing in production
